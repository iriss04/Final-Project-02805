For this part of the project we go in deeper analysis of the dataset. Here you will see the word clouds we created. Finding communities and calculate their TF-IDF. Then finally sentiment of communities. 

## Word clouds
We created word clouds for the top categories: 
- Gods
- Goddesses
- Peoples
- Creatures
- Mortals
- Titans

The six different WordClouds provides a good overview of what the gods, goddesses, peoples, creatures, mortals and titans have in their text files. The gods clearly have one word in common - son. The people text have many familiar expressions as son, family and father. This gives an indication that the peoples text include many family relation. The creature text includes words as horse, centaur and sphinx which is not surprising since the text most likely descirbe what kind of species the creatuers are. In the WordCloud for the mortals three words stand out - son, king and troy. The Trojan war is a big event in the greek mythology which reflects the texts of the mortals. The word "titan" is the most repeated word of the titans, which is not very surprising but gaia - the godess of earth may also seem as a very important godess for the titans.
